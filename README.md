## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical ASP.NET Core Web API pattern:

- **Controllers:** Contains controller classes that handle HTTP requests and serve responses.
- **Services:** Contains service classes responsible for business logic and data manipulation.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Defines data models used for communication between clients and the API.
- **Authentication Service:** Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Pet Service:** Provides functionalities related to managing pets and orders in the store.

## Key Features

- **Pet Management:** Implements CRUD operations for pets, allowing users to manage pet records.
- **Order Management:** Facilitates the creation and retrieval of orders placed by users.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Utilizes JWT-based authentication for secure access to endpoints. Supports user registration, login, and role-based access control.
- **Validation and Error Handling:** Implements robust validation checks and error handling mechanisms for data integrity and graceful error responses.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core:** A cross-platform framework for building modern web applications and services.
- **C# Programming Language:** The primary language used for development.
- **Entity Framework Core:** An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for database interactions.
- **JWT Authentication:** A token-based authentication mechanism for securing APIs.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** A tool for documenting and testing APIs.

## Getting Started

To run the PetStore API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your database connection string in `appsettings.json`.
3. Run database migrations to create necessary tables (`dotnet ef database update`).
4. Build and run the application (`dotnet run`).
5. Access the API endpoints using your preferred HTTP client or Swagger UI (typically available at `http://localhost:5000/swagger`).

## Authentication

Authentication in the PetStore API is based on JWT tokens. To access protected endpoints, clients must include a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request. Users can obtain JWT tokens by registering or logging in through the appropriate endpoints.

## Conclusion

Thank you for exploring the PetStore API project! I hope this repository demonstrates my proficiency in building scalable, secure, and well-documented APIs using ASP.NET Core. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.
